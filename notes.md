Going to production

1. Why firebase?
NoSQL databases
It is proven by a large number of developers and backed by google.
Real time data.
Versatile: Can work with any front-end.

The course uses jquery and underscore templates: two technologies I am not familiar with.
After seeing this, I want to run away and look for another course.
11:30-11:51
I have decided to stick around after looking around for about 5 minutes.

### Firebase firestore
Easily sync data to different apps.
Basics, reading, writing, querying data, indexing and security of data

### Create project
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/
2. Click the create project button.
3. Allow analytics add the analytics property and click create project.
    Finishing upâ€¦ssdb-test
Your new project is ready
Click continue and get redirected to project dashboard.

Enable firebase
By default the firebase used realtime database. Change that configuration by:
    1. Enable cloud firestore
    2. Configuration script.

Currently, firebase gives you a choice.
Click on Develop > database to create database.
Choose: Start in production mode
click next, and then done.
After this is done, click on project overview again.
Choose web (</>) icon to get the configuration details.
Choose the web app name: 
and click register.
Copy the code that appears

<!-- The core Firebase JS SDK is always required and must be listed first -->
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.14.0/firebase-app.js"></script>

<!-- TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
     https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries -->
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.14.0/firebase-analytics.js"></script>

<script>
  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyCznAjymiDvNREhQEHDeJxoZHZJZiS_kIo",
    authDomain: "ssdb-test.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://ssdb-test.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "ssdb-test",
    storageBucket: "ssdb-test.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "914852613263",
    appId: "1:914852613263:web:12ff66e91be80715c6f4fa",
    measurementId: "G-4SXN5R7T9Q"
  };
  // Initialize Firebase
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
  firebase.analytics();
</script>

then click proceed to console.

### Setup the development environment:


Struggled to look for the link to clone. The basic setup project. The github link provided does not have the files indicate. So I abandoned that tutorial and I am now looking for Articles that have:
Vanilla javascript and firebase implementation.
I Have found two articles that I want to look at and try them.
1. https://medium.com/@rajatamil/learn-to-build-firebase-crud-app-with-javascript-part-1-reading-data-b3f8f8e0d924
2. https://medium.com/@rajatamil/in-this-firebase-crud-javascript-web-tutorial-you-will-be-learning-how-to-do-create-update-and-c3ca4f4da15d
These uses realtime db while I my setup has firestore database.

Vanilla Javascript and firebase app.

Create a new project:medium-sunday
Go back to the console home page.

Click on web deployment and give the app a nickname: 
<!-- The core Firebase JS SDK is always required and must be listed first -->
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.14.0/firebase-app.js"></script>

<!-- TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
     https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries -->
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.14.0/firebase-analytics.js"></script>

<script>
  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyC_-aEzOYrB4AcTRTpJECjcrpLnRS4AmH8",
    authDomain: "medium-sunday.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://medium-sunday.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "medium-sunday",
    storageBucket: "medium-sunday.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "1037577406253",
    appId: "1:1037577406253:web:8d8c44df2fe203cc6cb5a4",
    measurementId: "G-V1GDKZ4HDK"
  };
  // Initialize Firebase
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
  firebase.analytics();
</script>


### Create json file
Since this database system uses json to store data
Sample user json data: 

{
  "users" : [ 
     {"name": "Alex Meraz",
       "age" : 24,
       "email" : "ameraz@email.com"
     },
     {"name":"Mohammed Rafi",
       "age" : 21,
       "email" : "mrafi@email.com"
     },
     {"name":"Raja Tamil",
       "age" : 31,
       "email" : "rtamil@email.com"
     },
     { "name":"Sundar Pichai",
       "age" : 21,
       "email" : "spichai@email.com"
     }]
}

Open a text editor and paste this data:
Save as json file with a .json filename extension.

### Choose realtime database:
Click the Realtime database option:
Choose Start in test mode option that has this json:
Get set up quickly by allowing all reads and writes to your database.
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
Get set up quickly by allowing all reads and writes to your database
Click on the three dots menu and click import data.
Choose your json file and add it.

### Reading the data from the database
A had an error that troubled me:
Uncaught TypeError: firebase.database is not a function at 

If you check the code, you copypasted, there is  a comment:

<!-- TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries -->
If you read this comment, it says to add any products you need, so in your case, add the line:


It turns out I had to add realtime db script tag below the first script tag and that sorted it.
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.14.0/firebase-database.js"></script>


https://medium.com/codingurukul/firebase-for-web-firebase-realtime-database-9280a52ced83
This tutorial ended up helping me in making basic operations in firebase.

var database= firebase.database();

// Basic read operation on our existing data
database.ref('users').on('value',(snap)=>{
    var usersData= snap.val()
    console.log(usersData)
})
// End of basic read operation
You should be able to get a result with the data already in the database.


I will use it for the other operations: delete and update.
